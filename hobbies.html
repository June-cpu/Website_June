                <p> I enjoy lots of sports with my friends and because they are so fun to me. I have been playing forever, some games i've played, you've probably never heard of because they have no names and we played them back in bangladesh. </p>

                I love playing Badminton, Probably my favorite sport at the moment because its so fun. a lot of my family is really good, some even played semi pro. I like to think I am pretty decent at it as well

                <img src="Earth.png" alt="Travel image">
                <p> I always loved traveling but I did not really get to do it much til this summer. Our family decided this would be the summer we traveled a lot.</p>

                <p> I have traveled to a few places before and my favorite place is Bangladesh. I love my home country and going there brought back so many memories and nostalgia.</p>

                <p> Exploring new places and understanding history and culture is so amazing to me.</p>

                <img src="Quran.png" alt="Religion image">
                <p>I come from a pretty religious family. I dislike reading books of any kind and I don't think i have ever finished a whole book, ever. 
                </p>

                <p>
                However, when it comes to the Quran, I love everything about it. One of my biggest interests is to memorize the whole thing.
